# Setup Artifacts to Import on Startup

Artifacts are specified in a different configuration file whether you're using Alpaca with GitHub or Azure DevOps:

## [GitHub (AL-Go)](#tab/github)

Artifacts are configured in [`containerConfigurations.artifacts` in `alpaca.json` config file](setup-cosmo-json.md). The defined artifacts are automatically installed in the dev containers during the container startup. Artifacts defined in the `default`, `current`, `NextMajor` or `NextMinor` container configurations are also automatically installed for build containers started from the respective AL-Go workflows.

## [Azure DevOps](#tab/azdevops)

Artifacts are configured in [`bcArtifacts.artifacts` in `cosmo.json` config file](setup-cosmo-json.md). The defined artifacts are automatically installed in the dev containers during the container startup. Artifacts defined in the `current`, `nextMajor` or `nextMinor` `bcArtifacts` sections are also automatically installed for build containers started from the respective Azure DevOps pipelines.

---

Four types of artifacts are supported:

1. Artifacts from a URL or the Alpaca fileshare
1. Artifacts from a NuGet feed
1. Artifacts from an Azure DevOps Artifact feed (only for Alpaca on Azure DevOps)
1. Artifacts from a product feed

# URL or Alpaca fileshare

1. Open the Alpaca fileshare. Please contact the Alpaca support if you don't have access yet.
1. Copy your artifact to the fileshare. One option to organize your folder structure could look like this, but if you have some other structure already in place in your organization, it also might be a good idea to use that:
   * product-artifacts used by multiple projects: `/common/<product>`
   * artifacts related to a customer project: `/<customer-name>/<project-name>`
1. Add the artifact to `artifacts` in your respective configuration file (see above):

## [GitHub (AL-Go)](#tab/artifact-url-github)

```json
{
    "artifacts": [
        {
            "type": "url",
            "name": "myapp",
            "version": "1.2.3.4",
            // fileshare paths can reference a file or ZIP file
            "url": "C:\\azurefileshare\\my.app",
            "target": "app" // can also be DLL, RapidStart, Fonts, etc.
        },
        {
            "type": "url",
            // URLs MUST reference a ZIP file
            "url": "https://my.blob.core.windows.net/test/myapp/myapp_1.2.3.4.app.zip?sv=2019-02-02&...",
            "target": "app"
        }
    ]
}
```

## [Azure DevOps](#tab/artifact-url-azdevops)

```json
{
    "artifacts": [
        {
            "name": "gbedv GmbH & Co. KG_OPplus Extension",
            "version": "17.0.201002.0",
            // fileshare paths can reference a file or ZIP file
            "url": "C:\\azurefileshare\\customer-acme\\bc-implementation\\OPplus_17.0.201002.0.runtime.app",
            "target": "app"
        },
        {
            "name": "For NAV DLL",
            // URLs MUST reference a ZIP file
            "url": "https://my.blob.core.windows.net/test/ForNAV/ForNav.Reports.5.2.0.1924.dll.zip?sv=2019-...",
            "target": "dll",
            "targetFolder": "ReportsForNAV_5_2_0_1924"
        },
        {
            "name": "For NAV App",
            // URLs MUST reference a ZIP file
            "url": "https://my.blob.core.windows.net/test/ForNAV/ForNAV%20Report%20Pack%205.2.0.0%20for%20BC15ONPREM%20(5.2.0.1924).app.zip?sv=2019-02-02&...",
            "target": "app"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You need to escape the folder separator `\` by using `\\` because the value must be a JSON-String.
> The fileshare path always is `c:\azurefileshare` inside of a container. That means that if you place a file `fantastic-app.app` in the root of your fileshare, you need to reference it as `c:\\azurefileshare\\fantastic-app.app`.
> Fileshare artifacts can be a "normal" files or an archive (`.zip` extension) which will be extracted during the container startup.

1. [Grant read access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions?view=azure-devops&tabs=nuget%2Cnugetserver22%2Cnugetserver#feed-settings) to the feed for the respective users as well as the pipelines by adding the `Project Collection Build Service (<org-name>)` group in Azure DevOps. This group has access to all feeds in the organization.
1. Get the needed information for your artifact feed
   ![Feed Artifact](../media/artifact-feed-information.png "Feed Artifact")
1. Add the Artifact to `artifacts` in your configuration file:

   ```json
    {
        // ...
        "devopsArtifacts": [
            {
                "organization": "AL-Workshop",

        ],          
        // ...
    }
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Only `upack` artifacts are supported.
> The `upack` artifact name is always lower case.
> Use the project ID for `project`
> When you have a project-scoped feed in a different project of the same organization, follow [the instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/project-scoped-feeds?view=azure-devops#q-how-can-i-access-a-project-scoped-feed-in-another-project-from-my-pipeline).

# Product feed

The use case for the product feed is to enable users and pipelines/workflows to consume artifacts managed in a central feed. This is mainly used for feeds hosting intelectual property. As a bonus you can use the version overview in the VS Code Extension to browse your regularly used artifacts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is currently only available for **COSMO** users to consume the COSMO products.

1. Find out which name the IP artifact has and which version you want to use
2. Add the Artifact to `ipArtifacts` in your configuration file

The `target` specifies the target folder and finally what should hapen with the artifact.

|Target(s)|Destination|Import|
|-|-|-|
|`bak`                          |---                                         |The **first** *(not ignored)* `bak` Artifact is used as database backup file during container creation.|

|`dll` or `add-ins`             |`<serviceTierFolder>/Add-Ins/<targetFolder>`|The Artifact will be imported as a DLL or Add-In.|
|`font` or `fonts`              |`c:/fonts`                                  |The Artifact will be imported as a Font.|
|`app`, `fob`, `rapidStart`, ...|`C:\run\my\apps`                            |The Artifact content will be imported as an App, Fob or RapidStart package depending on the file extension.|

The order of import is:

1. DLL(s) and Add-Ins
2. Font(s)
3. FOB(s)
4. App(s)
5. Rapid Start Package(s)

## Examples

### Add Fonts as Artifacts

Adding an additional font to a container **requires** you **to add also the default fonts as an additional artifact**. This is because there are not fonts installed in the container and your Business Central Reports might use your additional font as default font for your reports.

Here is an example how to add additional fonts as artifacts. Please note the `ignoreIn` setting as you probably won't need the fonts in a build pipeline and as they require a restart of the service tier, they make the pipeline slower and can cause issues with symbol loading in hybrid dev setups.
