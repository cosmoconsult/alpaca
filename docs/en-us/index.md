# COSMO Alpaca

COSMO Alpaca is intended to make the usage of Azure DevOps and GitHub (AL-Go) in general and the usage of Containers in the context of D365 Business Central as easy as possible for developers, consultants and project managers. It currently is available through a Visual Studio Code extension for project and container management.

After installation you can select between *technical* or *functional* which will affect the UI and UX to make it more suitable for your role. The VS Code extension is therefore also easily usable by non-technical users in the browser via [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/).
For a complete installation guide, see [VS Code in the browser](getting-started/vscode-dev.md).
