# COSMO Alpaca

COSMO Alpaca is intended to make the usage of Azure DevOps in general and the usage of Containers in the context of D365 Business Central as easy as possible for developers, consultants and project managers. It currently is available through two clients:

- A Power App for project and container management
- A Visual Studio Code extension for project and container management

The VS Code extension is meant for more technical users and developers who spent most of their time in VS Code anyways while the PowerApp is easier to use through the browser also by non-technical people. A lot of functionality is available in both the VS Code extension and the Power App, so often you can just decide what works better for you.

If you want to find out what we have done recently, there is a [What's new page](history-roadmap/whats-new.md) and you can also get an idea what our current plans for improvements to the service are by checking our [What's next page](history-roadmap/whats-next.md)
