# Create Standalone Container

If you want to quickly create a container without a connection to a repository and without setting up a configuration you can do so by following these steps:

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension in the *Containers* view click on the `+` icon to create a new on-demand container.
1. Enter a name for your new container.
1. Enter the BC version for your new container.
1. Enter the country for your new container.
1. Choose if you want to enable premium experience or not.
1. Optionally, enter a specific version number for your new container or use the default pre-filled value.
1. For Sandbox containers, choose if you would like the latest, next minor or next major version.
1. Wait until the container was created and is shown in the list. If someone else already used a similar container, this just takes a few seconds. Else this might take up to 20 minutes the first time.
1. After your container was created, the color of the icon shows the status of the container. The red icon indicates that the container is starting. As soon as the icon turns blue, the container is ready to access it.
