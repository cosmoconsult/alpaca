- Change time for the Portainer restart to 4am GMT

## v0.11.5

- Add test libraries (functional and performance) when creating images: Whenever a new image is created, the test libraries are imported into the database, so they are always directly available after the container starts. This also requires that a license file is added to the call when the image is created as it is not possible to import the test libraries with a Cronus license
