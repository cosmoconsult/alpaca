## v1.2.16

* Specify the source of the last artifact that is used to check for break changes [#1493](https://dev.azure.com/cc-ppi/General/_workitems/edit/1493/)
* Allow publishing apps in a folder structure app/test on the pipeline [#940](https://dev.azure.com/cc-ppi/General/_workitems/edit/940/)
* `cosmo.json` is by default no longer read directly from the file system, but instead a call to our backends is made to get it. This is needed for the `cosmoArtifacts` to be resolved, but also means that secrets like `$(devlic-bc19-de)` are directly resolved through the Azure Key Vault in the backend, so you **no longer need to update the library variables to get changes from the Key Vault, e.g. if licenses expire**. As a side-effect of that however, it also means that you **can't override Azure Key Vault secrets through library variables** anymore. To use the same example as before, `$(devlic-bc19-de)` will always be read from the Azure Key Vault, no matter if you have a local library variable or not. If you want to use a library variable, you need to give it a different name like e.g. `devlic-customerX` and reference it as `$(devlic-customerX)`. Directly referenced elements like e.g. `c:\\azurefileshare\\licenses\\mySuperLicense.flf` are not affected, the change only is relevant for secrets. Also, if you never manually changed the value of a library variable, nothing changes as well.
  *Note: The `cosmo.json` from the file system is used as fallback, when something went wrong during the backend call. In this case a warning is added to CI task `Setup Variables`*

## v1.2.15

* Fix pool reference to point at library variable instead of project name [#1316](https://dev.azure.com/cc-ppi/General/_workitems/edit/1316/)

## v1.2.14

* Use server jobs for starting the agents in the self-service backend to avoid wait times for Microsoft cloud agents [#405](https://dev.azure.com/cc-ppi/General/_workitems/edit/405/)

  * StartStopVM is now set to `true`
  * DeploymentTestJobs template set to `""`
* New general template group for `BC` added
* Deprecation Warning added to `Import` task groups: `Import Artifacts with import tasks is deprecated and will be removed soon.`
* Change log corrected (version mismatch)

## v1.1.9

* New Parameter `Docker.WarningString` (Default: `[WARN]`) which raises an warning during Docker Start, when this warning string appear in the container log.

## v1.1.8

* Variable `testImportAction` for C/AL hybrid pipelines added. The default value is "overwrite"

## v1.1.7

* Respect parameter "multitenant" from cosmo.json in builds as well

## v1.1.6

* If `skipDeploy` is set to `true`, the whole "Create Release" job is skipped (https://dev.azure.com/cc-ppi/General/_workitems/edit/226)

## v1.1.5

* New Parameter `Docker.ErrorString` (Default: `[ERROR]`) which raises an error during Docker Start, when this error string appear in the container log.

## v1.1.4

* Support to get custom startup scripts from the repository as explained [here](https://docs.cosmoconsult.com/en-us/cloud-service/devops-docker-selfservice/containers/setup-custom-scripts.html)

## v1.1.3

* Task "ALOps Import Test Toolkit" is now removed for BC15, BC16, BC17 (for older versions we don't have the AL-based test toolkit, so it isn't there at all) because the generated container contains now the test toolkit.
* Refactoring task "Setup Variables":
  * `--env licenseFile=<licenseFile>` is now always added to `dockerParamsForBuild`, therefor the initial ALOps License Import is removed.
  * fix: excluded empty variables
  * fix: avoid empty license parameter for docker image creation
  * Added check for `dockerParamsForBuild` to prevent special characters (`\r`, `\n`) throwing an error as Docker startup encounters unexpected behavior.
  * `--isolation=...` is always removed from `dockerParamsForBuild`. Furthermore, when you need Isolation, than add `isolation` in `cosmo.json` this will add the `--isolation=...` in `dockerParamsForBuild`. The **default value for `isolation` is `Process`** which works best for `bcArtifacts` on Docker Swarm environment.
  * Variable `artifactsScope` in `cosmo.json` overrule now the scope for the used artifact feed, when present
* Initial license import is completely removed, because license is imported by `--env licenseFile=...` in `dockerParamsForBuild`
* Error handling improved for task "Create Docker Image"
* Fallback for DockerImage creation for bcArtifact "ALOps Create DockerImage" was removed. This is not longer necessary, because step "Create Docker Image" do this at Docker Swarm environment.
* Variable `LicenseScope` removed. Now the license is imported during "Docker Start" (passed to `dockerParamsForBuild` as environment parameter `--env licenseFile=...`) into the default scope: `NavDatabase`.
* changelog added
* readme.md updated

## v1.1.2

* fix: Artifact with name 'Dynamics 365 App' not found.
* readme.md updated

## v1.1.1

* fix: Artifact with name 'Dynamics 365 App' not found.
