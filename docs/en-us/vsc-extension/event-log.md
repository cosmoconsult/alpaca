# Get the event log

To troubleshoot problems within your container it's often helpful to have a look at the event log. The event log can be easily downloaded:

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension select your container.
1. From the command palette search for and choose **CC: Download container event log**.
1. Select a directory to store the log file to.
1. Open the downloaded event log with the event viewer.
