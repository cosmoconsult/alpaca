# Create a container with configuration from a specific branch

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

To test out a change in either the `cosmo.json` or your [custom scripts](../containers/setup-custom-scripts.md) without affecting other users, you can create a container and use the configuration and custom scripts from a specific branch:

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension right click on a branch with your changes under the Repository of your app and choose **Create container with configuration from this branch**.
1. Enter a name for your new container and hit Enter.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Similar as when [creating a container the default way](create-container.md) you need to wait until the container is created and ready.
