# Select a different tenant

If you are working with Azure DevOps organizations connected to different Azure tenants, you might have to select a specific tenant to see the organization you need. You can do that by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of the COSMO Alpaca view and then select "Select Azure tenant". You then need to enter the tenant ID or the tenant domain and will be asked to log in again. If you do that successfully, you will see the organizations in the selected tenant.

If you regularly need to switch tenants we heavily recommend to set up [separate profiles in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) for the different tenants.
