# Onboard existing projects and apps

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

If you're having projects created without the Alpaca tooling you may want to use the Alpaca for those projects as well. For that, a project needs some setup which can be done by using the onboarding functionality:

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension select a project you want to onboard
1. Open the command palette (F1) and choose **CC: Onboard this project for usage with the self-service**
