# Share a container with a colleague

If you want to share a container with a colleague, so that it appears in their tooling as well, you can take the following steps:

1. Right-click on a container and select "Change owners"
1. Add or remove owners. If you have more than one, they need to be separated with commas (no blanks)
1. The container is automatically restarted so the changes get applied.

You can see it step by step here:
