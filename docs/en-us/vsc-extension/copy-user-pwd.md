# Get User/Password

When [creating a new container](create-container.md) a user and a random password is automatically created for you. Alternativeley you can set up a default username and password by setting the *Default Container Password* and *Default Container Username* option within the extension settings. This credential is used for accessing the Business Central Web Client.

You can read the docs on [how to open the Business Central Web Client](open-container.md). To quickly copy your username and password to login right click on your Container in the Visual Studio Code extension either choose **Copy password to clipboard** or **Copy username to clipboard**.
