# Create a bug report or feature request

If you run into issues while using the Visual Studio Code extension or any part of Alpaca you can either

- directly report a bug from the error you received.
- report a general issue for any part of the self-service.

If you have ideas how to improve the extension or any part of the self-service you can also create a feature.

We will then try to understand, reproduce and fix your issue or implement the feature. We get in contact with you if we need additional information or to update you on the progress of your bug report or feature request.

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

## Report a bug for a specific error

In the error notification just click **Create bug report** and a new Bug within Azure DevOps is created and pre-filled for you with your extension configuration and some context information to help us understand your issue. You just need to add the repro steps and **Save** the WorkItem.

## Report a general bug or feature request for any part of the self-service

In the Visual Studio Code extension view click on the three dots (`â‹¯`) in the top right and choose **Create bug report** or **Create feature request**. A new Bug or User Story within Azure DevOps is created and pre-filled with your extension configuration as well. You again need to add the repro steps or the description of the feature you want and **Save** the WorkItem.
