# Open a repository, pipeline/workflow, requirement, project or organization in the browser

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

Most of the elements in the tree of the "Azure DevOps" view can be opened in a browser, e.g. a repository, build, workitem, project or organization. To achieve that, you just right-click on the element and select "Open in browser". The exception is the workitem, which has a directly clickable icon.
