_This is only available for COSMO CONSULT_

# [**GitHub (AL-Go)**](#tab/github)
WIP

# [**Azure DevOps**](#tab/azdevops)

In addition to [assigning a customer](assign-customer.md), an organization must always be assigned a responsible user who is (organizationally) accountable and responsible for the customer project. Normally, this is represented by the role of the project management.

To assign a responsible user, right-click on the organization and select **Assign responsible user**. A list of all users of the DevOps organization is displayed and the selected user will be assigned as the responsbile user.
