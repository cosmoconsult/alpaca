# Associate Work Items

When you are working on a repository in Azure DevOps using VS Code, you can directly assign work items to branches, pull requests, and commits. In most cases, when you are working on the development of Business Central, you will be working on a repository in the context of an organization in Azure DevOps. In that case, you might want to keep track of the work that you do using work items in Azure DevOps. Therefore, you can associate work items to your branches, pull requests, and commits.

The extension allows you to search for work items that have already been created in the project and assign them to branches, pull requests, and commits.
