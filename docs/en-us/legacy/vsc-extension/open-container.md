# Open Container

When you want to access or interact with a container in Azure DevOps, you can use the "Open container" action. To open a container, right-click on the container you want to open and select **Open container**:

This will open the container in your web browser, allowing you to:

- View container details and configuration
- Access the Business Central Web Client
- Manage users and permissions
- View logs and diagnostic information
- Configure container settings

Once the container opens in your browser, you can interact with it according to your needs.
