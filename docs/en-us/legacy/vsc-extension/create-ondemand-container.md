# Create On-Demand Container

An on-demand container is a temporary container that is created on-the-fly for a specific purpose, such as testing or validation. Unlike regular containers that persist until deleted, on-demand containers are typically ephemeral and may be automatically cleaned up after use.

To create an on-demand container in Azure DevOps, right-click on a project and select **Create on-demand container**:

You will be prompted to provide:

1. **Container name**: A name for your temporary container
2. **Container type**: The type of container you need
3. **BC version**: The Business Central version
4. **Country**: The country localization
5. **License**: The license to use

Once the on-demand container is created, you can use it for your immediate testing and development needs. Remember that this container may be subject to automatic cleanup policies, so plan accordingly for your temporary work.
