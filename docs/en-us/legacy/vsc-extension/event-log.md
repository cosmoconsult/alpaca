# Event Log

The Event Log provides a record of all activities and events that occur within your containers. To view the event log for a container in Azure DevOps:

1. Right-click on the container whose event log you want to view
2. Select **Event log**
3. The event log will open in your web browser

The event log shows:

- Container lifecycle events (creation, deletion, start, stop)
- Configuration changes
- User login events
- System events and errors
- Application deployment activities

You can filter the event log by:

- **Date range**: View events from a specific time period
- **Event type**: Filter by specific types of events
- **Severity**: Show only critical events, warnings, or informational events

The event log is useful for:

- Troubleshooting issues
- Auditing container activities
- Monitoring container health
- Tracking changes made to the container
