# Restart Service Tier

The "Restart service tier" action allows you to restart the Business Central service tier in a container. This is useful when you need to apply configuration changes or resolve service-related issues.

To restart the service tier in a container:

1. Right-click on the container whose service tier you want to restart
2. Select **Restart service tier**
3. Confirm that you want to restart the service
4. The service tier will restart

You will see a notification when the service tier has successfully restarted. During the restart, the service will be temporarily unavailable.

> [!WARNING]
> Restarting the service tier will temporarily interrupt access to the Business Central instance. Ensure that no critical operations are in progress before restarting.
