# Work with Branches

## See and interact with branches

You can find the branches directly below the repository where they belong to. The list of branches shows you the name and the creator.

With a right-click, you open the branch in the browser or you can create a Pull Request with the master branch. In the latter case, a browser window opens and asks you for the necessary inputs to do the Pull Request.

## Create a branch to work on a work item

If you want to work on a work item, you will probably need a dedicated branch. To make that very easy, there is an action to do that. To use it, take the following steps:

1. Find the work item that you want to work on
1. Right-click on the work item and select "Work on this (create brach)"
1. In the popup that appears next, select the repository that you want to use
1. In the next popup select the base branch that you want to base your branch on
1. Enter the name of your branch in the entry box that comes up next
1. The branch will be created and connected to the work item. When it is done, you will see a notification "Branch created"

After that, you will find the branch in the usual place and you can see in the work item that it is now connected to the new branch, if you open it in the broswer.

You can watch it step by step here:
