# Manage CI/CD Updates

When there are updates available for the CI/CD automation framework used in your project, you can update them directly from VS Code using the "CI/CD Update" action. This allows you to keep your CI/CD process up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.

To update the CI/CD automation of your app, right-click on the repository where you want to update the CI/CD automation and select **CI/CD Update**:

The extension will then check for updates and show you what will be updated. You can review the changes and confirm the update. A pull request will be created with the updates, which you can review and merge into your main branch.
