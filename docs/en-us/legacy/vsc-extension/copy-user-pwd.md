# Copy User Password

When working with containers in Azure DevOps, you may need to access user credentials. The "Copy user password" action allows you to copy the password of a user in a container, which you can then use to log in or authenticate.

To copy a user password from a container:

1. Right-click on the container that contains the user whose password you want to copy
2. Select **Copy user password**
3. A list of users in the container will appear
4. Select the user whose password you want to copy
5. The password will be copied to your clipboard and a notification will appear

> [!WARNING]
> Handle passwords securely. Do not share passwords unnecessarily, and remember to clear your clipboard after use if you're working on a shared machine.
