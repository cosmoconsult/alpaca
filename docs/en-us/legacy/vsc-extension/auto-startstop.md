# Auto Start/Stop Container

The "Auto Start/Stop" feature allows you to configure automatic scheduling for container startup and shutdown. This helps manage resources efficiently by starting containers when needed and stopping them during off-hours.

To configure auto start/stop for a container:

1. Right-click on the container you want to configure
2. Select **Auto start/stop**
3. A configuration dialog will appear where you can set:
   - **Start time**: When the container should automatically start
   - **Stop time**: When the container should automatically stop
   - **Days**: Which days of the week this schedule applies to
   - **Timezone**: The timezone for the schedule

Once configured, the container will automatically start and stop according to your specified schedule, helping to optimize resource usage and reduce costs.
