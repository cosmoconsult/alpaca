# Share Container

If you want to share a container with other team members or colleagues in Azure DevOps, you can use the "Share container" action. This allows other users to access and work with the same container environment.

To share a container:

1. Right-click on the container you want to share
2. Select **Share container**
3. A sharing dialog will open where you can:
   - Select the users or groups to share the container with
   - Set their access level (view, edit, or full access)
   - Add a message explaining the sharing purpose

Once you confirm the sharing, the selected users will have access to the container based on the permissions you assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the users you're sharing with have the necessary permissions in the Azure DevOps project.
