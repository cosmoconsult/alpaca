# Create Container

When you want to set up a container environment for development or testing in Azure DevOps, you can use the "Create container" action. To create a container, right-click on a project where you want to create a container and select **Create container**:

A dialog will open asking you to provide:

1. **Container name**: A name for your container
2. **Container type**: Whether you want a development or sandbox container
3. **BC version**: Which Business Central version to use
4. **Country**: Which country localization to use
5. **License**: Which license to use

Once you provide these details, the extension will create a container with the specified configuration. The container will be set up with all necessary artifacts and configurations needed for your development work.

You will see a notification when the container has been successfully created. After that, you can use the container for development, testing, and debugging your Business Central applications.
